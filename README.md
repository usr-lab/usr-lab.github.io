## How-to
### Add a news
Go to [`_pages/index.md`](_pages/index.md) and add the news at the top after `Most recent news`. If the list of most recent news is becoming long (3-4) consider moving one of the oldest news to the top of the old_news file: [`_pages/old_news.md`](_pages/old_news.md) (remember to add a heading with a new year if missing).

Format for news: the date is in ***italic bold*** and contains the year if it is in the `index.md` file but *does not* once it is move to the `old_news.md`. Title of papers go in *italic*, awards go in **bold**, venues can go in italic but not necessarily. Try to also include relevant liks if possible.

### Add a member
Go to [`_pages/people.md`](_pages/people.md), depending on the new member scroll to `feature_row_professors`, `feature_row_postdocs`, `feature_row_phds` or `feature_row_masters` and add a new member. Place the profile picture under `assets/images/people`. It is important that the format of the image is jpg (otherwise it will break the members system in the publications page) and that the filename only contains the name of the new member e.g. `alessio.jpg`.

### Remove a member
Go to [`_pages/people.md`](_pages/people.md) and remove the member, also go to `assets/images/people` and delete their profile photo. Then put their name and former role in the Alumni section of [`_pages/people.md`](_pages/people.md)

### Add a publication
Place the publication picture (if any) under `assets/images/publications`. Go to [`_pages/index.md`](_pages/index.md) and add a new entry under `feature_row` *and* delete the last entry. Go to [`_pages/publications.md`](_pages/publications.md) and add the new entry under `feature_row`. If the list becomes very long, please consider removing the last entry from the `feature_row` and add the publication under `Older publications`. In that case, please remember to also delete the associated image under `assets/images/publications`!
